#A program that prints the whole range of number from 1 to 100 but if the number is divisible by 3 then you print Fizz, if the number
# is divisible by 5 you print Buzz and if it is both divisible by 3 and 5 then you print Fizz Buzz
#Example: 3,9,12 = Fizz; 5,10,20 = Buzz; 15,30, 45 = Fizz Buzz
for n in range(1,101):   
  if n%3==0 and n%5==0:
    print("Fizz Buzz")
  elif n%3==0:
    print("Fizz")  
  elif n%5==0:
    print("Buzz")
  else:
    print(n)
