# ADvanced BMI Calculator with elif function
height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

bmi=weight/(height*height)
#{} denotes it is a literal
#: introduces it is a format spec
#0 enables sign-aware zero-padding for numeric types
#.2 sets the precision to two decimal points
#f displays the number as a fixed-point number
print("Your BMI is "+"{:0.2f}".format(bmi))
#The desired output is a BMI with two decimal points after zero

#The program must check for if the BMI is greater than or equal to 35 first it counts down from 35
if bmi>=35:
  print("You are clinically obese.")
#At this point if the value is less than 35 it runs the line below
elif bmi>=30:
  print("You are obese.")
#At this point if the value is less than 30 it runs the line below
elif bmi>=25:
  print("You are overweight.")
#At this point if the value is less than 25 it runs the line below
elif bmi>=18.5:
  print("You have a normal weight.")
 #At this point if the value is less than 18.5 it runs the line below
else:
  print("You are underweight.")

#ALTERNATIVE CODE that counts from 18.5 to 35

height = float(input("enter your height in m: "))
weight = float(input("enter your weight in kg: "))

bmi=weight/(height*height)
print("Your BMI is "+"{:0.2f}".format(bmi))

if bmi<18.5:
  print("You have a under weight.")
elif bmi<=24: #18.5-24 normal
  print("You are normal weight.")
elif bmi<=30: #25-30 over weight
  print("You are over weight.")
elif bmi<=34: #31-34 obese
  print("You are obese.")
else:
  print("You are clinically obese.")
