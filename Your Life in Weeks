#Here you input your age
age = input("What is your current age?")
#Then we get the difference from the life expectancy of 90 and we have to convert it to an integer
diff_age=90-int(age)
#Then we get the difference in days, weeks and months
m=diff_age*12
w=diff_age*52
d=diff_age*365
#By using f strings which is just an f before a string we can combine the data types seamlessly with curly braces
print(f"You have {d} days, {w} weeks, and {m} months left")

#Input: 56
#Output: You have 14600 days, 2080 weeks, and 480 months left
